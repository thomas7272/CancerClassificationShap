## Project Title
**Cancer Diagnosis Interface Using Machine Learning**

## Description
This project aims to develop an interactive web application that leverages machine learning algorithms to assist in the diagnosis of cancer. The application allows users to input medical data and receive predictions about the likelihood of cancer, along with detailed insights into the diagnosis process. This tool is designed to aid medical professionals and researchers in making informed decisions based on data-driven analysis.

## Features
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for easy data input and result interpretation.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions.
- **Data Visualization:** Visual representation of input data and prediction results for better understanding.
- **Real-time Analysis:** Instant prediction and feedback upon data submission.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Ensures that user data is protected and handled with confidentiality.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - HTML/CSS
  - Chart.js for data visualization

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
